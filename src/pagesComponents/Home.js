                   My name is Keitu Mokgabudi, an animation and interactive student. I aspire to learn more on illustration and concept creation in the aniamtion field; 
                   to learn more and eventually specialize in interactive website designs that evoke the ease of user interactivity and experience and evoke emothional feelings.
                   I aim to grow my knowledge in website design, moreover still as a student in this field, I do believe there is still much to learn. 
                   This site piece is one still much in progress and I hope to grow with it as I learn more on providing its viewers with designs that will bring beauty and creatvity their user experience.
